### Overview

ðŸ”† Chore Wheel is a framework for helping groups share space.
By lowering the cost of cooperation, we help communities create abundance.

Chore Wheel was inspired by Elinor Ostrom's [eight principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom#Design_principles_for_Common_Pool_Resource_(CPR)_institution) of common-pool resource management, Stafford Beer's [cybernetic vision](https://monoskop.org/images/e/e3/Beer_Stafford_Designing_Freedom.pdf) of computers as sense-making tools, and Frederic Laloux's [inquiries](https://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/en/) into self-managing organizations.

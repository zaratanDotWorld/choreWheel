### Overview:

ðŸ”† Chore Wheel (formerly Mirror) is self-governance software for coliving, helping reshape the economics of housing.

Developed in collaboration with social scientists and game designers, Chore Wheel is a set of tools and processes which enable groups of individuals to easily and effectively share space, without reliance on expensive managers or tedious meetings. By lowering the cost of cooperation, Chore Wheel helps to bring coliving into the mainstream, reducing both the price and environmental impact of housing.

Chore Wheel draws influence from the work of Elinor Ostrom, and is designed in reference to her [eight principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom#Design_principles_for_Common_Pool_Resource_(CPR)_institution):

1. Clearly defined the group boundaries (and effective exclusion of external un-entitled parties) and the contents of the common pool resource;
2. The appropriation and provision of common resources that are adapted to local conditions;
3. Collective-choice arrangements that allow most resource appropriators to participate in the decision-making process;
4. Effective monitoring by monitors who are part of or accountable to the appropriators;
5. A scale of graduated sanctions for resource appropriators who violate community rules;
6. Mechanisms of conflict resolution that are cheap and of easy access;
7. Self-determination of the community recognized by higher-level authorities; and
8. In the case of larger common-pool resources, organization in the form of multiple layers of nested enterprises, with small local CPRs at the base level.

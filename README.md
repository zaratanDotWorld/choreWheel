### Overview

ðŸ”† Chore Wheel is self-governance software for coliving, helping reshape the economics of housing.

Developed in collaboration with social scientists and game designers, Chore Wheel is a set of tools and processes which enable groups of individuals to easily and effectively share space, without reliance on expensive managers or tedious meetings. By lowering the cost of cooperation, Chore Wheel helps to bring coliving into the mainstream, reducing both the price and environmental impact of housing.

Chore Wheel draws influence from the work of Elinor Ostrom, and is designed in reference to her [eight principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom#Design_principles_for_Common_Pool_Resource_(CPR)_institution) of common-pool resource management. Read the **[project whitepaper](https://kronosapiens.github.io/papers/mirror.pdf)** for more details.

### Architecture

Chore Wheel is functionally-design, with most data being modeled as append-only logs. This allows for flexibility and robustness, while minimizing the likelihood of errors.
